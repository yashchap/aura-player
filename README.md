## Introduction
* The system was built during University of Southern California, ACM TrojanHacks held on 14-15th October 2018. 
* AuraPlayer enables the user to interact by describing how the user feels, based upon the user's voice response, the system generates a curated playlist of 12 songs dependent on user's emotion/mood.
* The system is built upon IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding API for identifying the sentiment score of the user's voice input such as happy, sad, anger, disgust.
* The score is then fed as a seed to the Spotify's API to generate the desired playlist
